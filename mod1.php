                        <p>
                            In this module, we discussed Client-side vs. Server-side coding, which is essentially the difference between
                            code that is compiled locally, on the users end, or remotely on the servers end.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>
                            Moreover, we talked about File Sharing programs. In my assignment, I covered Google Docs or Google Drive. 
                            It is my opinion that it is the best platform to share and collaberate on simple documets.
                            However, for code development (website or application), I prefer to use <a href="http://c9.io">Cloud 9</a> Which
                            enables you to share a workspace (like container) with x amount of collaborators, and run the scripts 
                            on the container that you are using to create your project.
